# SSH Brute Force Script

This script attempts to brute force the password for a given SSH username on a target IP address using a provided password file.


## Usage

* Provide the target IP address
* Provide the username to bruteforce
* Provide the location of the password file

## Warning

Please note that brute forcing is illegal and unethical and should not be done without proper authorization.
Prevention

To prevent such attacks, it is important to take the following steps:

* Use strong and unique passwords for all SSH accounts
* Limit the number of failed login attempts by enabling login failure lockout
* Use a firewall to block all incoming SSH traffic except from trusted IP addresses
* Use public key authentication instead of password authentication
* Keep your system and SSH software up to date
* Regularly monitor your system logs for any suspicious activity
* Implement a VPN solution, that provides an additional layer of security to your network
* Use two-factor authentication for all remote access, to add an extra layer of security to your remote access solution

By following these best practices, you can help to ensure that your systems are better protected against brute force attacks and other types of malicious activity.
